                This downloads the extension from a secure URL to ensure that no

            <h2>Firefox</h2>
            <div class="alert alert-warning hide not-firefox">
                Looks like you're not using Firefox. You can of course still
                download the Firefox add-on, but don't try to install it anywhere else.
            </div>
            <p>
                The firefox add-on is currently not available on the AMO store due
                to the enormously long release times. A delay of up to ten days between
                creating the release and the release being published won't be a problem
                once the software is stable, but this add-on simply isn't stable yet.
