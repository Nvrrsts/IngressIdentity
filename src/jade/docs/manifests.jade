        p.
            A manifest file is a spreadsheet containing the following columns:
        dl.dl-horizontal
            dt lastupdated
            dd
                p
                    em Required.
                    | A unique number. This number has to be updated every time the source sheet this row describes is updated.
                p
                    | Proposed value:
                    blockquote.
                        YYYYMMDDXX
                    | where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day
                    | and XX is the lowest positive number that results in
                    | a unique number, e.g. 2014043001.
            dt tag
            dd
                p
                    em Required.
                    | A human readable name for the source. The extension will display this instead of the key.
            dt faction
            dd
                p
                    em Required<sup>1</sup>.
                    | Either 'enlightened', 'resistance' or 'unknown'.
            dt key
            dd
                p
                    em Required.
                    | The key of the source file. This tells the extension where to find the spreadsheet. For more information, see <a href="#key">this help section on keys</a>.
            dt refresh
            dd
                p
                    em Required.
                    | The amount of hours to wait before updating this source file again. The extension may take up to one hour longer than the alotted refresh rate.
                p.
                    All integer values are allowed. Negative values are
                    the same as 0: reload every hour.
            dt &hellip;
            dd
                p
                    em Optional.
                    | You can create other columns at will. These will be
                    | optional, and will be seen as extratags. If the column name is also added
                    | in extratags, the data in extratags is overwritten.
                dl.dl-horizontal
                    dt anomaly</dt>
                    dd
                        p.
                            One of '13magnus', 'recursion', 'interitus' or 'helios'.
                            Other values are ignored. New values will
                            be added for future anomalies.
                    dt community<br>event
                    dd
                        p A value of type
                        blockquote OID: name
                        p.
                            For more information on the OID, see
                            <a href="./tools.html#oid">the tools page</a>.
                        p.
                            The name can be anything as long as the cell
                            contains valid JSON.
                p.
                    Example: the spreadsheet has an 'anomaly' column. The
                    data in this column will overwrite the 'anomaly' value
                    in the manifest if that value exists.
        p.
            Note 1: The faction has to be defined at least <em>once</em> for every
            player. You can omit this data if you are sure that all players
            in the source file are already defined elsewhere. This allows you
            to e.g. have a source for an event where you include both factions
            at the same time.
            See <a href="compatibility.html">the compatibility page</a> for more information.
