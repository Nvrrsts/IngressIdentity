            This page contains some tools that can help you when using this extension.
    +row
        h2#key Manifest key
        p.
            Simply enter the manifest URL below, and this page will give you the
            key to use.

            .form-group
                label(for='manifest_url') Manifest URL
                input#manifest_url(type='text', class='form-control')
            .form-group
                label(for='manifest_key') Manifest Key

    +row
        h2#oid OID
        p.
            An OID is a unique identifier. People, pages, events and communities
            each have an OID. Finding it for events and communities is easy, but
            it can be tricky for people.
        h3 Events and Communities
        p.
            Events and communities have a simple URL structure:
        blockquote
            p.tt https://plus.google.com/events/OID/...
            p.tt https://plus.google.com/communities/OID/...
        p.
            Note that there might be a <span class="tt">/u/0</span> in the URL.
        h3 People
        p.
            People are slightly more tricky, as they can choose a custom URL.
            You'll have to find a link to the person's profile, instead of taking
            the URL of the profile page itself. To see what we mean, take a look at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://google.com/+KlueS">Klue's profile</a>.
            If you look at the URL, you will see the following:
        blockquote
            p.tt https://plus.google.com/u/0/+KlueS/posts
        p.
            There's no OID there. If you hover over any of the links to Klue's profile,
            however, you will see a link with an OID:
        blockquote
            p.tt https://plus.google.com/u/0/110350977702120778591
        h3 Tool
        p.
            This tool filters out the OID for any person, community or event. Note that
            it won't work with the personalised URLs like Klue's above, you'll have to
            get the link.
        form(role='form', action='#')
            .form-group
                label(for='oid_url') Person/Event/Community URL
                input#oid_url(type='text', class='form-control')
            .form-group
                label(for='oid_oid') Person/Event/Community OID
                input#oid_oid(type='text', class='form-control')
