The manifests had a major update. The extratags column is now deprecated,
please use extra columns in the spreadsheet instead. As always, backwards
compatibility is maintained.

- Allow extra columns in manifests and source. These override the extratags:
    extratags -> extra column in manifest -> extra column in source
- Improved error handling: data errors player data are shown on profile
- Page loads are more responsive
- Allow dummy rows in manifests
- Allow local source urls in manifests
