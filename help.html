                        This extension links ingress players with Google+ identities.
                        It does that using data provided by its user. Yes, that's you.
                        You provide the extension with information regarding a player's
                        Google+ userid, their nickname, their level and even which anomalies
                        they went to and in which Google+ communities they're active.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This information should be put on Google Drive spreadsheets.
                        We'll use two kinds of spreadsheets: sources and manifests:
                    </p>
                    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                        <dt>Source</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A source spreadsheet contains information about players.
                            Most important are their &ldquo;oid&rdquo;, their in-game
                            nickname and their level.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Manifest</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A manifest is merely a collection of sources. It tells us which
                            sources are linked to it, how often we should check for updates,
                            gives the source a name (also called &ldquo;tag&rdquo;) and
                            give general metadata.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>

                        as change their order. It also sets various options like whether
                        or not you want Ingress player info to be shown for user mentions
                        in posts and comments.

                        You can add a manifest using the &ldquo;Add manifest&rdquo; button.
                        Before you press this button, you'll have to find the key of the manifest
                        though. For more information, see our section on <a href="#key">keys</a>.

                    <p>
                        The order of the source files matters! If two sources define the same attribute, e.g.
                        two source files declare a player's level, the latter of the two will have precedence.
                        If the two values differ, the last one will be the value shown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that you'll have to maintain the right order of source files withina single
                        manifest. Put the ones that are updated the most last, so they can override any outdated
                        values defined in earlier sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same goes for the manifests themselves. The order shown on the options page is
                        the order in which the manifests are loaded. The source files of the last manifest
                        have precedence over the source files of all other manifests, so be sure to put the
                        manifests that are regularly updated last.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You could also put the manifests/sources you trust the most last. If, for example, you
                        have a manifest for the Recursion anomaly you went to nearby and a manifest for the
                        players (enlightened and resistance) in your town. You'll want to put the local manifest
                        last, because you can trust its values more than you can trust the other manifest. The
                        other contains a lot of players. A mistake is easy to make, or an enemy player could've
                        snuck in. If you have that enemy player in the correct faction in the other manifest,
                        the extension will show that faction, being the correct one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can change the order of the manifests by simply dragging and dropping the panels
                        shown on the option page (an example of such a panel is shown above).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The options page contains a lot of layout options. You can decide whether you want anomaly badges
                        to be shown, whether you want player info next to mentions in posts or whether you want links to
                        the source files to be added to community pages. All the options are enabled when installing this
                        extension for the first time.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is <b>important</b> to note that the first data row of a
                        Google Drive spreadsheet <em>must</em> contain a value for all columns!
                        Not complying with this requirement will result in rows or columns
                        not being discovered. This requirement stems from the
                        Google API we use to read the spreadsheets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using a dummy in the first row is advised, cf. the example
                        document. Be sure to use a key containing only 9s for the
                        dummy in a manifest spreadsheeet and an oid with only 9s for
                        the dummy in a source file, a the extension will ignore these.

                        Note that a person's URL can be different if they have chosen a
                        URL shorthand. To give an example, the page of <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+HankJohnsonNomad">+Hank Johnson</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The links to the person's id still contain the OID though. Try
                        hovering over Hank Johnson's name in the first post on his profile
                        page. You'll see that the URL is
                    </p>

                        This contains the OID.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, Google+ will add <span class="tt">/u/0</span> to the URL.
                        You can simply ignore this. The profile of Hank Johnson can also be
                        found at

                <div>
                    <h2 id="about"><a name="about"></a>About the extension</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are active ingress players. All our local and not-so-local
                        communities use Google+ to communicate. The number of people
                        we've met both online and offline due to ingress is grwoing so
                        large that we can't keep up with remembering who's who. When
                        playing we wonder who this player is, and whether that player
                        is on holiday. When active on Google+, we're wondering who exactly
                        asks for help or notifies us of enemy player activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making this extension was not an original idea. We took the manifest
                        files from <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cemdjcbehkacgpiielmiakooedjkkphk">another extension</a>
                        and implemented a new extension to show this data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why did we do this? Because we believe in open source. This extension's
                        code is licensed under the MIT license. Anyone can use it, anyone
                        can modify it. Of course we would like for the modified code to
                        be open source as well, but we won't force anyone to open source
                        their code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also wanted a modern interface, instead of the tables based UI
                        the original extension delivers. No offense to the author, but this
                        isn't the 90s anymore.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Notes on compatibility -->
                    <h3 id="compat"><a name="compat"></a>Compatibility with the original extension</h3>
                    <p>
                        The manifests and sources this extension uses to fetch its data
                        are perfectly compatible with the manifests and sources of the
                        original extension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This has a couple of drawbacks. There are things we would do differently
                        but haven't for the sake of compatibility:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The extratags column in the manifest files. We would see that
                                removed and use extra columns instead.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have a source file for an anomaly, you often want to
                                set 'anomaly' to the name of that anomaly, 'community' to the
                                community you're in for the anomaly and 'event' to the event
                                you went to. The resulting extratags becomes quite cluttered.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                See the notes above: we would make the faction, name, level
                                and nickname optional as long as they're provided at least
                                <em>once</em> per player.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
